## 📖 Abstract
Medication adherence is a major challenge for patients, especially for those with chronic illnesses or memory-related issues.  
Our solution is an **Automated Pill Dispenser** that uses **Arduino Uno, RTC (DS3231), IR Sensor, Servo Motor, Buzzer, and LCD** to:  
- ⏰ Dispense pills at **predefined times**  
- 🔔 Alert the user with a buzzer  
- 👀 Detect user presence with an IR sensor  
- 📟 Display reminders on an LCD  

This ensures **accuracy, safety, and independence** for patients.
